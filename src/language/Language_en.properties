description = Description:
description1 = Brutha is the Chosen One. \n His god has spoken to him, admittedly while currently in the shape of a tortoise. \n Brutha is a simple lad. He can't read. He can't write. He's pretty good at growing melons. And his wants are few.\
\n He wants to overthrow a huge and corrupt church. \
\n He wants to prevent a horrible holy war.\
\n He wants to stop the persecution of a philosopher who has dared to suggest that, contrary to the Church's dogma, the Discworld really does go through space on the back of an enormous turtle (*).\
\n He wants peace and justice and brotherly love. He wants the Inquisition to stop torturing him now, please.\
\n But most of all, what he really wants, more than anything else, is for his god to Choose Someone Else ...\
\n (which is true, but when has that ever mattered?)

description2 = In the year 2044, reality is an ugly place. The only time teenage Wade Watts really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the OASIS. \

he'll have to win\u2014and confront the real world he's always been so desperate to escape.
